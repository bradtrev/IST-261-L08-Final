TreeSet
Thinking back to 210, I remembered the importance of minimizing many-to-many relationships when storing data. 
For this reason, I want to create a TreeSet which holds associations between Movie IDs and Actor IDs. 
TreeSets can add, remove, and search in logarithmic time, which is very helpful if a movie object is called to be displayed; 
all associated actor IDs with that movie ID can be acquired quickly.


MovieActorData is encapsulating the TreeSet collection.
